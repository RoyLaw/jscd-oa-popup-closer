FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The user script is based on TamperMonkey plugin for Chrome browsers. 

That means you should have TamperMonkey(GreasyFork) installed first. 

Then, you can install and subscrible this userjs script on <a href="https://openuserjs.org/scripts/roylaw/%E5%8A%9E%E5%85%AC%E7%BD%91%E5%BC%B9%E7%AA%97%E5%85%B3%E9%97%AD%E5%99%A8">OpenUserJS</a>.

Now, the script can mute some popup when you visit the OA system.
